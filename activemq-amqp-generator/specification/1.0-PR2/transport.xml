        The AMQP Network consists of <i>Nodes</i> connected via <i>Links</i>. Nodes are named
        entities responsible for the safe storage and/or delivery of Messages. Messages can
        originate from, terminate at, or be relayed by Nodes. A Link is a unidirectional route
        between two Nodes along which Messages may travel if they meet the entry criteria of the
        Link. As a Message travels through the AMQP network, the responsibility for safe storage and
        delivery of the Message is transferred between the Nodes it encounters. The Link Protocol
        (defined in the <xref name="links"/> section) manages the transfer of responsibility between
        two Nodes.

        Nodes exist within a <i>Container</i>, and each Container may hold many Nodes. Examples of
        AMQP Nodes are Producers, Consumers, and Queues. Producers and Consumers are the elements
        within a client Application that generate and process Messages. Queues are entities within a
        Broker that store and forward Messages. Examples of containers are Brokers and Client
        Applications.

      <p>
        The AMQP Transport Specification defines a peer-to-peer protocol for transferring Messages
        between Nodes in the AMQP network. This portion of the specification is not concerned with
        the internal workings of any sort of Node, and only deals with the mechanics of
        unambiguously transferring a Message from one Node to another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Containers communicate via <i>Connections</i>. An AMQP Connection consists of a full-duplex,
        ordered, reliable, authenticated, and (optionally) encrypted sequence of <i>Frames</i>. The
        precise requirement for a Connection is that if the n-th Frame arrives, all Frames prior to
        n MUST also have arrived. It is assumed Connections are transient and may fail for a variety
        of reasons resulting in the loss of an unknown number of frames, but they are still subject
        to the aforementioned ordered reliability criteria. This is similar to the guarantee that
        TCP or SCTP provides for byte streams, and the specification defines a
        <xref name="framing"/> system used to parse a byte stream into a sequence of Frames for use
        in establishing an AMQP Connection over TCP or SCTP.
      </p>

      <p>
        Containers conduct stateful dialogs via named <i>Sessions</i>. An AMQP Session is a
        full-duplex, ordered, reliable command transport with positive acknowledgment, flow control,
        and error handling. Sessions send commands over an associated Connection. When a Session is
        associated with a Connection it is said to be <i>attached</i>. When a Session is not
        associated with a Connection it is said to be <i>detached</i>. Detached Sessions retain
        conversational state for a period determined by a negotiated timeout. A single Connection
        may have multiple Sessions attached, up to a negotiated limit. Both Connections and Sessions
        are modeled by each peer as <i>endpoints</i> that store local and last known remote state
        regarding the Connection or Session in question.

      <p>
        A Session defines a strict order of execution on commands and maps to a single thread of
        control (note this does not necessarily imply a single OS thread). Sessions provide a scope
        for transactional interactions, and a facility for demarcating transactional units of work.
        Within a Session, the Link Protocol (defined in the <xref name="links"/> section) is used to
        establish Links between local and remote Nodes and to transfer Messages across them. A
        single Session may simultaneously operate on any number of Links.

        A <i>Frame</i> is the unit of work carried by a Connection. There are two types of
        frames: <i>Connection</i> frames, and <i>Session</i> frames. <i>Connection</i> frames are
        processed by the Connection endpoint. Connection frames are used to open and close an AMQP
        Connection as well as to establish a secure transport prior to initiating an AMQP
        Connection. <i>Session</i> frames are processed by the Session endpoint. Session frames
        carry additional state pertaining to the acknowledgment and flow control features of the
        Session. Session frames are used to attach and detach Session endpoints, as well as to carry
        the Commands sent over a Session. Specific Session Commands are defined for transferring
        Messages along a Link (See <xref name="links"/>) as well as establishing transactional
        boundaries.

      <p>
        Prior to sending any frames on a Connection, each peer MUST start by sending a protocol
        header that indicates the protocol version used on the Connection. The protocol header
        consists of the upper case ASCII letters "AMQP" followed by a protocol id of zero, followed
        by three unsigned bytes representing the major, minor, and revision of the protocol version
        (currently <xref name="MAJOR"/>, <xref name="MINOR"/>, <xref name="REVISION"/>). In total
        this is an 8-octet sequence:

|  "AMQP"  |   %d0   |  major  |  minor  | revision |
+----------+---------+---------+---------+----------+
]]>
      </picture>

      <p>
        Any data appearing beyond the protocol header MUST match the version indicated by the
        protocol header. If the incoming and outgoing protocol headers do not match, both peers MUST
        close their outgoing stream and SHOULD read the incoming stream until it is terminated.
      </p>

      <p>
        The AMQP peer which acted in the role of the TCP client (i.e. the peer that opened the
        Connection) MUST immediately send its outgoing protocol header on establishment of the TCP
        Session. The AMQP peer which acted in the role of the TCP server MAY elect to wait until
        receiving the incoming protocol header before sending its own outgoing protocol header.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two AMQP peers agree on a protocol version as follows (where the words "client" and
        "server" refer to the roles being played by the peers at the TCP Connection level):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            When the client opens a new socket Connection to a server, it MUST send a protocol
            header with the client's preferred protocol version.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If the requested protocol version is supported, the server MUST send its own protocol
            header with the requested version to the socket, and then proceed according to the
            protocol definition.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If the requested protocol version is <b>not</b> supported, the server MUST send a
            protocol header with a <b>supported</b> protocol version and then close the socket.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            When choosing a protocol version to respond with, the server SHOULD choose the highest
            supported version that is less than or equal to the requested version. If no such
            version exists, the server SHOULD respond with the highest supported version.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            If the server can't parse the protocol header, the server MUST send a valid protocol
            header with a supported protocol version and then close the socket.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Based on this behavior a client can discover which protocol versions a server supports by
        attempting to connect with its highest supported version and reconnecting with a version
        less than or equal to the version received back from the server.

    <doc title="Opening a Connection">
      <p>
        Each AMQP Connection begins with an exchange of capabilities and limitations. After
        establishing or accepting a TCP Connection and sending the protocol header, each peer must
        send an <xref type="type" name="open"/> control before sending any other frames. The
        <xref type="type" name="open"/> control describes the capabilities and limits of that peer.
        After sending the <xref type="type" name="open"/> control each peer must read its partner's
        <xref type="type" name="open"/> control and must operate within mutually acceptable
        limitations from this point forward.

    <doc title="Pipelined Open">
      <p>
        For applications that use many short-lived Connections, it may be desirable to pipeline the
        Connection negotiation process. A peer may do this by starting to send commands or controls
        before receiving the partner's Connection header or <xref type="type" name="open"/> control.
        This is permitted so long as the pipelined commands and controls are known a priori to
        conform to the capabilities and limitations of its partner. For example, this may be
        accomplished by keeping the use of the Connection within the capabilities and limits
        expected of all AMQP implementations as defined by the specification of the
        <xref type="type" name="open"/> control.

    <doc title="Closing a Connection">
      <p>
        Prior to closing a Connection, each peer must write a <xref type="type" name="close"/>
        control with a code indicating the reason for closing. This control must be the last thing
        ever written onto a Connection. After writing this control the peer should continue to read
        from the Connection until it receives the partner's <xref type="type" name="close"/>
        control.

    <doc title="Simultaneous Close">
      <p>
        Normally one peer will initiate the Connection close, and the partner will send its close in
        response. However, because both endpoints may simultaneously choose to close the Connection
        for independent reasons, it is possible for a simultaneous close to occur. In this case, the
        only potentially observable difference from the perspective of each endpoint is the code
        indicating the reason for the close.

    <doc>
      <p>
        An AMQP Session is a named dialog between two AMQP peers. Each participant maintains a
        Session Endpoint that stores the conversational state for that Session. Session Endpoints
        must be associated with an open Connection in order to be <i>attached</i>. Session Endpoints
        may become detached deliberately, or when a failure occurs (either in the network or at one
        of the endpoints). While detached the Session Endpoint will retain state while the
        Connection it was last associated with remains open, and thereafter for its configured
        timeout value. The timeout setting may be zero (indicating state should not be retained
        beyond Connection closure) or it may be set such that the endpoint retains state
        indefinitely.
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Naming a Session">
      <p>
        Session names are supplied by the initiating peer, and MUST be globally unique among all
        open Sessions. Once a Session is cleanly closed, its name may be reused. Session names are
        represented by opaque binary strings. Example naming schemes include mechanically generated
        UUID-based names as well as stable, manually chosen URI based names. Session names are only
        exchanged during the attach and detach procedures, so there is no significant overhead to
        choosing long names.
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Establishing a Session">
      <p>
        Sessions are established by creating a Session Endpoint, assigning it to an unused channel
        number, and sending an <xref type="type" name="attach"/> carrying the state of the newly
        created Endpoint. The partner responds with an <xref type="type" name="attach"/> carrying
        the state of the corresponding Endpoint, creating and/or mapping the Endpoint to an unused
        channel number if necessary. To avoid accidentally resuming an existing Session, the
        initiating peer may optionally wish to verify that the corresponding Endpoint is newly
        created by checking that the received opening flag matches the sent opening flag.

    <doc title="Resuming a Session">
      <p>
        Sessions are resumed by assigning the existing detached Session Endpoint to an unused

        resuming Endpoint. The partner responds with an <xref type="type" name="attach"/> carrying
        the state of the corresponding Endpoint, creating and/or mapping the Endpoint to an unused
        channel number if necessary. The resuming peer may wish to verify that the corresponding
        Endpoint is not newly created. This may be used to detect whether conversational state has
        been lost.

    <doc title="Detaching a Session">
      <p>
        Sessions become detached automatically when the Connection is cleanly closed (with the
        exchange of AMQP <xref type="type" name="close"/> controls), interrupted (when the network
        transport is removed without a <xref type="type" name="close"/> exchange), or when an error
        is encountered while executing a command. A Session is explicitly detached by sending a
        <xref type="type" name="detach"/> control. Once the <xref type="type" name="detach"/> is
        sent, no more commands or controls may be sent to the other Session Endpoint without first
        reattaching. The detaching peer MUST read and discard incoming commands until the other
        Endpoint's <xref type="type" name="detach"/> is received.

        Sessions are closed by setting the closing bit on the <xref type="type" name="detach"/>
        control, and detaching in the normal way. If an Endpoint sets the closing bit, it indicates
        that after the detach is confirmed (via the receipt of a corresponding
        <xref type="type" name="detach"/> control, also with the closing bit set) the Endpoint will
        be destroyed.

      <p>
        If a Session becomes detached without being cleanly closed, then the Endpoints are required
        to retain state until the the Connection closes and the timeout has been reached. If in this
        case an Endpoint has locally set its closing bit, but has not had confirmation from the
        other Endpoint that it too is closing, then it has a responsibility to attempt to reattach
        in order to close cleanly.
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Simultaneous Detach/Close">
      <p>
        Due to the potentially asynchronous nature of Sessions, it is possible that both peers may
        simultaneously decide to detach and/or close the Session. If this should happen, it will
        appear to each peer as though their partner's spontaneously initiated
        <xref type="type" name="detach"/> is actually an answer to the peers initial
        <xref type="type" name="detach"/> control. One observable consequence of this occurrence is
        that if one Endpoint is closing and the other Endpoint is detaching, the values of the
        closing flag may not match. In this case, the closing Endpoint should reattach and verify
        that the detaching Endpoint was actually closed.

    <doc title="Command Transport">
      <p>
        A Session may be used as both a synchronous and an asynchronous command transport. By
        waiting for each command to be acknowledged prior to sending the next command, a Session
        becomes a fully synchronous command transport, and by permitting many unacknowledged
        commands a Session can become a fully asynchronous, full-duplex, transport.
      </p>

      <p>
        The diagram below depicts a snapshot of a Sender and Receiver in the process of sending and
        executing commands. The snapshot assumes perfect knowledge of the Sender and Receiver states
        at a given instant, and serves as an essential illustration of the different possible
        conditions that may occur when sending commands. For simplicity, the diagram shows only the
        state for a single Sender and Receiver pair.

    <doc title="State Exchange">
      <p>
        Session Endpoints periodically exchange the following state
        variables: <i>executed</i>, <i>capacity</i>, <i>acknowledged</i>, and <i>command-id</i>.
        These state variables are carried on session frames (see <xref name="framing"/>). In
        addition, endpoints also exchange the <i>received</i> state variable whenever they
        (re)attach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each endpoint uses the knowledge of its partner's executed state to shrink the replay buffer
        for outgoing commands. Each endpoint uses the knowledge of its partners capacity to match
        its transmission rate to its partner's available receive capacity. Endpoints may use the
        knowledge of their partners acknowledged state to bound the set of incoming commands subject
        to replay at any given point.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Session endpoints (re)attach, they compute where to begin replay (if necessary), the id
        of the next incoming command, and when to block outgoing commands.

      <p>
        When sending a command, the session state carried with the command represents a snapshot of
        the endpoint state at the time the command is first sent. This implies it MUST NOT be
        altered if a command is replayed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any state update detected by the recipient MUST be processed <b>after</b> the contained
        command is executed. This means the receiver infers an ordering between issued commands and
        state updates that may be different from the actual ordering in which they occurred at the
        sender. If it is important for the receiver to know the true ordering, the sender MUST send
        the relevant state update in a separate frame. This may be done by sending an empty command
        or control frame.
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Session Exceptions" >
      <p>
        Session exceptions occur when an error is encountered while processing a command. In this
        case the receiving peer MUST detach the Session by issuing an outgoing detach control
        acknowledging the last successfully executed command and carrying information about the
        exceptional condition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon receiving any explicit detach, including those caused by exceptions, clients may choose
        to reattach and resume just as they would from an ordinary network failure. If the detach
        was caused by an exception, the client may choose, upon resume, to alter or omit any
        unexecuted commands, i.e. those following the exceptional condition. A client SHOULD examine
        the cause of failure and determine if it is likely to resolve itself before replaying
        unmodified commands.

    <doc title="Transactional Sessions">
      <p>
        A Transactional Session is one in which one of the two Applications using the Session
        behaves as a Transactional Resource, and the other behaves as a Transaction Controller. A
        Transactional Session must be in one of three modes: "local", "distributed", or
        "promotable". In these modes, the Transaction Controller defines transactional units of
        work, and indicates whether each unit of work is a success or failure. On a Session with a
        txn-mode of "local", each successful unit of work is immediately committed as a complete
        transaction, and failed units of work are immediately rolled back. On a Session with a
        txn-mode of "distributed", each unit of work is given an xid and becomes part of a
        distributed transaction that is externally coordinated. On a Session with a txn-mode of
        "promotable", each unit of work may optionally be given an xid to become part of an
        externally coordinated distributed transaction, or if not given an xid it is treated as in
        the "local" mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        Applications capable of behaving as a Transactional Resource may advertise this when
        establishing a Session by setting the txn-support field of the
        <xref type="type" name="attach"/> control to "local", "distributed", or "promotable".
        Applications that wish to behave as a Transaction Controller may indicate this and choose
        the mode for the Transactional Session by setting the txn-mode field of the
        <xref type="type" name="attach"/> control when establishing a Session. Only one end of a
        Session can be the Transaction Controller. It is an error for both Session endpoints to set
        the txn-mode field when when establishing a Session.
      </p>

      <p>
        The transactional implications of each Command are determined by the semantics of the
        Transactional Resource. Some Commands sent from the Transaction Controller to the
        Transactional Resource may modify transactional state, while others may not. Likewise, some
        Commands sent from the Resource to the Controller may carry information about the
        transactional state of the Resource, while others may not. The state of the Command
        Transport itself is not transactional. A Commit or Rollback may negate or confirm the
        effects of a Command carried by the Transport, but it has no effect on the command-ids,
        replay-buffers, or other Transport related state that falls within the scope of the
        transaction.

  <!-- == Section: links ======================================================================= -->

  <section name="links" label="the Link Protocol">
    <doc>
      <p>
        The Link Protocol is used to transfer Messages between Nodes. A <i>Link</i> forms a
        unidirectional conduit for Messages. Each Link consists of two <i>Link Endpoints</i>:
        an <i>outgoing</i> endpoint, and an <i>incoming</i> endpoint. The outgoing endpoint is
        associated with a <i>Source</i>, and the incoming endpoint is associated with
        a <i>Target</i>. The source defines which Messages are supplied to the outgoing endpoint for
        transfer, and the target defines how incoming Messages are disseminated. A Link may be
        established from either the outgoing or incoming end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once established, Links impose a <i>transfer-limit</i> that is used by the incoming endpoint
        to control the flow of Messages. When permitted by the transfer-limit, the outgoing endpoint
        initiates the transfer of available Messages and communicates a disposition for each
        transfer back to the Message source.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scope of a Link controls what happens to open Links when a Session is closed.
        A <i>container-scoped</i> Link Endpoint will be retained as long as the source and/or target
        continue to exist. A <i>session-scoped</i> Link Endpoint is discarded upon Session closure.
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Naming a Link">
      <p>
        Links are named so that Link Endpoints may be reconnected to each other when communication
        is interrupted. Link names are chosen by the initiating peer, and MUST be unique within
        their defined scope. The name of a container scoped Link MUST be unique among all Links from
        the incoming container to the outgoing container, and the name of a Session scoped Link MUST
        be similarly unique within the Session. This means that if either peer is permitted to
        initiate a Link, then a strategy must be employed for avoiding conflicts, e.g. using a UUID
        or dividing the available namespace in a prearranged manner. Link names are only used during
        the initial establishment or reestablishment of a Link, so they may be arbitrarily long
        without a significant penalty.
      </p>
    </doc>

    <doc title="Link Handles">
      <p>
        Each Link Endpoint is assigned a numeric handle used by the peer as a shorthand to refer to
        the Link in all commands that it sends in reference to the Link
        (<xref type="type" name="link"/>, <xref type="type" name="relink"/>,
        <xref type="type" name="unlink"/>, <xref type="type" name="flow"/>,
        <xref type="type" name="drain"/>, <xref type="type" name="transfer"/>,
        <xref type="type" name="bar"/>, <xref type="type" name="disposition"/>). The two Endpoints
        are not required to use the same handle. This means a peer is free to independently chose
        its handle when a Link Endpoint is associated with the Session. Each peer informs the parter
        of its chosen handle for a given Link in the Link establishment phase.

        If the partner finds a preexisting Link Endpoint, it MUST respond with the state of the
        existing endpoint rather than creating a new endpoint. This state may not match the state of
        the peer's endpoint. In the case where a Link is established between two endpoints with
        conflicting state, the outgoing endpoint is considered to hold the authoritative version of
        the source, the incoming endpoint is considered to hold the authoritative version of the
        target, and the resulting Link state is constructed from the authoritative source and
        target. Once such a Link is established, either peer is free to continue if the resulting
        state is acceptable, or if not, <xref type="type" name="unlink"/> or
        <xref type="type" name="relink"/>.

      <p>
        Container scoped Links exist beyond their host Session, so it is possible for a Session to
        terminate and the container scoped Link Endpoints to remain. In this case the Link may be
        resumed the same way a Link is initially established. The existing Link Endpoint is assigned
        a handle within the new Session, and a <xref type="type" name="link"/> command is sent with
        the state of the resuming endpoint.

    <doc title="Flow Control">
      <p>
        Once established, the outgoing end of a Link is subject to flow control of Message
        transfers. The outgoing end of the Link maintains a <i>transfer-count</i>, as well as a
        <i>transfer-limit</i>. The <i>transfer-count</i> is initialized to zero when the link is
        established, and is incremented as message data is sent. If the transfer-count is the same
        or greater than the transfer-limit, it is illegal to send more transfer commands until the
        transfer-limit is increased. The <i>transfer-unit</i> defines how the transfer-count is
        incremented. (See the <xref type="type" name="link"/> definition for details.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The incoming end of the Link updates the transfer-limit by sending <xref type="type"
        name="flow"/> commands. Flow control may be disabled entirely if the incoming end sends a
        <xref type="type" name="flow"/> command with an empty value for the limit. Although not
        required in all cases, it is often convenient for the incoming end of the Link to maintain a
        transfer-count based on the received message data for use in determining an appropriate
        value for the updated transfer-limit when sending a <xref type="type" name="flow"/> command.
        The transfer-count, the received transfer-count, and the transfer-limit are all absolute
        values. While the values themselves are conceptually unbounded, they are encoded as 32-bit
        integers that wraparound and compare according to RFC-1982 serial number arithmetic.

    <doc title="Controlling Outgoing Transfers">
      <p>
        As message data is transferred on a Session, the sender increments the transfer-count for
        the Link on which it is sent. AMQP peers must not send transfers in excess of the current
        transfer-limit of a Link. If the transfer-limit is reduced by the receiving peer when
        transfers are in-flight, the receiving peer may either handle the excess transfers normally
        or detach the Session with a transfer-limit-exceeded error code.

        The <xref type="type" name="flow"/> and <xref type="type" name="drain"/> commands control
        incoming transfers for a specific Link. The <xref type="type" name="flow"/> command updates
        the transfer-limit for the specified Link. The <xref type="type" name="drain"/> command
        tells the peer to send any immediately available transfers, and then set the transfer-limit
        equal to the sent transfer-count, thus stopping the Link. Once the <xref type="type"
        name="drain"/> command is complete, the Link will be stopped, and any immediately available
        transfers will have been sent if permitted by the transfer-limit prior to receiving the
        <xref type="type" name="drain"/>. These commands may be used to provide a variety of
        different behaviors for receiving Messages.

        outgoing end of the Link. Some transfers may be in-flight at the time the <xref type="type"
        name="flow"/> command is sent, so incoming transfers may still arrive on that Link until
        execution of the <xref type="type" name="flow"/> command is acknowledged.

    <doc title="Transferring a Message">
      <p>
        Every Message transferred on a Link results in a disposition being reported back to the
        source. A Message is considered <i>pending</i> from the point at which it was sent (without
        abort) until its disposition has been <i>settled</i>. The disposition has been settled only
        when the receiver becomes aware that the sender has finalized the disposition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each Message that is transferred MUST be identified by a delivery-tag chosen by the outgoing
        Link Endpoint. The delivery-tag MUST be unique amongst all <i>pending</i> Message Transfers
        on the Link. Under certain circumstances it may be difficult for the outgoing Link Endpoint
        to know when a disposition has been settled. Because of this, the outgoing Link Endpoint
        SHOULD choose a strategy that assigns a delivery-tag that is unique amongst all transfer
        attempts on the Link.
      </p>

      <p>
        An Outgoing Link Endpoint maintains a barrier that may be set to the delivery-tag of any
        pending Message Transfer, or cleared. The barrier divides the set of pending Message
        Transfers into two categories, <i>barred</i> Message Transfers, and <i>unbarred</i> Message
        Transfers.

      <p>
        Message Transfers cannot become finalized in the barred state. The receiver uses the
        <xref type="type" name="bar"/> command to set and clear the barrier and thereby control the
        division between barred and unbarred Message Transfers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon sending, every Message has a presumptive default disposition as specified by the
        source. Prior to finalizing the disposition, the receiver may request the default
        disposition be overridden by the sending the <xref type="type" name="disposition"/> command.
      </p>

      <p>
        The disposition at the sender is considered finalized when all its constituent
        <xref type="type" name="transfer"/> commands are acknowledged <b>and</b> the Message
        Transfer is in the unbarred state.
      </p>

      <p>
        The disposition at the receiver is finalized by acknowledging all the constituent
        <xref type="type" name="transfer"/> commands of an unbarred Message Transfer (See <b>Message
        Fragmentation</b> below), or by causing a barred, but acknowledged, Message Transfer to
        become unbarred. A Message Transfer becomes unbarred by setting the Link barrier beyond its
        delivery-tag or by clearing the barrier.

    <doc title="Message Fragmentation">
      <p>
        Messages may be transferred as multiple fragments. Each fragment includes a first flag, last
        flag, and format-code code that may be used to identify section boundaries and formatting
        within the Message. For example if Messages are divided into a separate header and body with
        distinct formats, the first, last, and format-code flags could be used to indicate the
        boundary between the header and body, and to indicate the distinct formatting of each.

      <p>
        Each <xref type="type" name="transfer"/> command may carry an arbitrary number of fragments
        up to the limit imposed by the maximum frame size. For Messages that are too large to fit
        within the maximum frame size, additional fragments may be transferred in additional
        <xref type="type" name="transfer"/> commands by setting the more flag on all but the last
        <xref type="type" name="transfer"/> command.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sender may indicate an aborted attempt to transfer a Message by setting the abort flag
        on the last <xref type="type" name="transfer"/>. In this case the receiver MUST discard the
        Message fragments that were transferred prior to the abort.
      </p>

      <p>
        Messages may be arbitrarily re-fragmented so long as the section boundaries and formatting
        are still recoverable from the first, last, and format-code fields.

            A list of locales that the sending peer permits for incoming informational text. This
            list is ordered in decreasing level of preference. The receiving partner will chose the
            first (most preferred) incoming locale from those which it supports. If none of the

            supplied in this list as it is always the fallback. A peer may determine which of the
            permitted incoming locales is chosen by examining the partner's supported locales as
            specified in the outgoing-locales field.

          The relink command updates the source and/or target definition(s) associated with an

          messages already successfully transferred along the link. Relinking will not always be
          possible, e.g. if the new and the old source refer to distinct nodes. If a relink is not
          possible, the receiver MUST unlink the link with an appropriate error before signaling the
          relink as executed.

            An invalid argument was passed to a command, and the operation could not proceed. An
            invalid argument is not illegal (see illegal-argument), i.e. it matches the type

            If the AMQP container acting as the Transaction Controller attempts to re-attach to the

            the Controller MUST manually rollback the current transaction before attempting any
