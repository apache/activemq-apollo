# Apollo ${project_version} STOMP Protocol Manual

{:toc:2-5}

## Using the STOMP Protocol

Clients can connect to ${project_name} using the
[STOMP](http://stomp.github.com/) protocol. STOMP provides an interoperable
messaging wire level protocol that allows any STOMP clients can communicate
with any STOMP message broker. It aims to provide easy and widespread
messaging interoperability among many languages, platforms and brokers.

${project_name} supports the following versions of the STOMP specification: 

* [STOMP 1.0](http://stomp.github.com/stomp-specification-1.0.html)
* [STOMP 1.1](http://stomp.github.com/stomp-specification-1.1.html)
* [STOMP 1.2](http://stomp.github.com/stomp-specification-1.2.html)

The specification is short and simple to read, it is highly recommend that users
to get familiar with it before using one of the many available client libraries.

### Stomp Protocol Options

You can use the `stomp` configuration element within the `connector` element
in the `apollo.xml` configuration file to change the default settings used
in the STOMP protocol implementation.  The `stomp` element supports the 
following configuration attributes:

* `buffer_size` : How much each producer or subscription will buffer between
   the client and the broker. If not set, it will be auto tuned between `640k`
   and `20k` depending on the number of connections open on the broker.
* `add_user_header` :  Name of the header which will be added to every received 
  message received.  The value of the header will be set to the id of user that 
  sent the message.  Not set by default.
* `add_timestamp_header` :  Name of the header which will be added to every received 
  message received.  The value of the header will be set to the time the message
  was received.  The time will be represented as the number of milliseconds elapsed
  since the UNIX epoch in GMT.  Not set by default.
* `add_redeliveries_header` :  Name of the header which will be added to messages
  sent to consumers if the messages has been redelivered.  The value of the header 
  will be set to the number of times the message has been redeliverd.  Not set 
  by default.
* `max_header_length` : The maximum allowed length of a STOMP header. Defaults 
  to `10k`.
* `max_headers` : The maximum number of allowed headers in a frame.  Defaults 
  to 1000.
* `max_data_length` : The maximum size of the body portion of a STOMP frame.  
  Defaults to `100M`.
* `die_delay` : The amount of time to delay in milliseconds after an `ERROR` 
  message is sent to the client and the socket is closed.

The stomp configuration element can also be used to control how the destination 
headers are parsed and interpreted.  The supported attributes are:
  
* `queue_prefix` : Defaults to `/queue/`
* `topic_prefix` : Defaults to `/topic/`
* `path_separator` : Defaults to `.`
* `destination_separator` : Defaults to `,`
* `any_child_wildcard` : Defaults to `*`
* `regex_wildcard_start` : Defaults to `{`
* `regex_wildcard_end` : Defaults to `}`
* `any_descendant_wildcard` : Defaults to `**`

It also supports nested `add_user_header` elements to more finely control how
user headers are added to received STOMP messages.  The `add_user_header` element
should contain the name of the header to set on the STOMP message.  It also 
supports the following attributes:

* `separator` : If user has multiple principles which match, this separator
  will be used to delimit them in the header.  If not set, then only the first
  matching principle will be set in the header.
* `kind` : The principle kind to look for.  Defaults to `*` (matches all 
  principle kinds)

Example:

{pygmentize:: xml}
<connector id="tcp" bind="tcp://0.0.0.0:61613">
  <stomp max_header_length="10000">
    <add_user_header separator=",">user</add_user_header>
  </stomp>
</connector>
{pygmentize}


### Client Libraries

There are many open source STOMP clients for different platforms and
languages.  You can find a full listing of available clients at:

* [`http://stomp.github.com/implementations.html#Clients`](http://stomp.github.com/implementations.html#Clients)

The ${project_name} distribution ships with an `examples` directory
where you can find some simple examples of how to use some of those
clients to send and receive messages from a broker instance.

This section will focus on clarifying the parts of the STOMP specification
which allow servers to choose their behavior and to describe how to access
${project_name} specific features.

### Connecting

The default broker configuration secures access to the broker so that only
the `admin` user can connect.  The default password for the `admin` user 
is `password`.

Example STOMP frame to connect to the broker:

    CONNECT
    
    login:admin
    passcode:password
    
    ^@

STOMP 1.0 clients don't specify which virtual host they are connecting to so
the broker connects those clients to the first virtual host defined in
it's configuration.  STOMP 1.1 clients must specify a virtual host when they
connect.  If no configured virtual host `host_name` matches the client's 
requested host, the connection is terminated with an ERROR.  Therefore,
it is critical that the virtual hosts configuration define all the 
possible host names that clients may connect to host with.

### Destination Types

${project_name} supports three types of destinations, queues, topics, and
durable subscriptions.

The difference between queues and topics is how messages are delivered to
consumers. A queue will load balance it's messages over the connected
subscribers so that only one subscriber gets a message. Topics replicate
every message sent to it to all the connected subscribers.  Queues hold 
on to unconsumed messages even when there are no subscriptions attached,
while a topic will drop messages when there are no connected subscriptions.

A durable subscription allows you to create a subscription against a topic
which will queue messages even after the client disconnects.  Clients
can reconnect and consume the queued message originating from the topic
at a later time.

If you want to send or subscribe to a queue, topic, or durable
subscription the STOMP destination should be prefixed with `/queue/`,
`/topic/` or `/dsub/` respectively.

Example STOMP frame sending to a queue:

    SEND
    destination:/queue/a

    hello queue a
    ^@

### Topic Retained Messages

If a message sent to a Topic has the `retain:set` header, then
the message will be 'remembered' by the topic so that if a new
subscription arrives, the last retained message is sent 
to the subscription.  For example if you want a topic 
to remember the last price published you can send a message 
that looks like:

    SEND
    destination:/topic/stock/IBM
    retain:true

    112.12
    ^@

You can also send a new message with the `retain:remove` header
to have the topic forget about the last retained message.

Note: retained messages are not retained between broker restarts.

### Reliable Messaging

${project_name} supports reliable messaging by allowing messages to be
persisted so that they can be recovered if there is failure which kills
the broker.  Processing persistent messages has orders of magnitude more
overhead than non-persistent variety.  You should only use it if your
application really needs it.

To have a message be persistent, the sender must add the `persistent:true`
header to the `SEND` STOMP frame.  Furthermore, if you are not sending the 
message in a transaction, it is recommend that you also add a `receipt`
header.  Once the broker responds with a `RECEIPT` frame correlated to 
the send, you are guaranteed the broker will not drop the message even if
a failure occurs.

Example:

    SEND
    destination:/queue/a
    receipt:001

    hello queue a
    ^@

The client should not consider the send to have succeeded until he receives
the correlated `RECEIPT` frame from the server.  Example:

    RECEIPT
    receipt-id:001
    
    ^@

It is important to note that to do reliable messaging, your system will
be prone to receive duplicate messages.  For example, if your sending 
application dies before it receives the `RECEIPT` frame, then when it starts
up again will probably try to send the same message again which may
cause a duplicate message to get placed on the broker.

You should only use subscribers which use the `client` or `client-individual`
ack mode to consume reliable messages. Any messages on a queue delivered to a
client which have not been acked when the client disconnects will get
redelivered to another subscribed client.

### Message Expiration

${project_name} supports expiring old messages.  Unconsumed expired messages 
are automatically removed from the queue.  There's two way to specify
when the message will be expired.  Y

The first way to configure the expiration is by setting the `expires` message 
header.  The expiration time must be specified as the number of milliseconds 
since the Unix epoch.

Example:

    SEND
    destination:/queue/a
    expires:1308690148000

    this message will expire on Tue Jun 21 17:02:28 EDT 2011
    ^@
    
The first way to configure the expiration is by setting the `ttl` message 
header.  The ttl will be intereted to mean the number of milliseconds from
when the server receives the message.  The broker will add an `expires`
header to the message on your behalf.

Example:

    SEND
    destination:/queue/a
    ttl:2000

    This message will expire in 2 seconds.
    ^@

### Subscription Flow Control

You can add a `credit` header to the `SUBSCRIBE` frame to control the
flow of messages delivered to the client. Each subscription maintains 2
credit windows which allows you to control the flow of messages either based
on number of messages sent or total number of content bytes delivered to the
client. The content bytes are the body of the frame which is usually also
set on the `content-length` header. If either of the two credit windows have
a positive value, the server will deliver messages to the client.

The `credit` header value is expected to use the
`count[,size]` syntax where:

 * count: initial setting of the credit window tracking the remaining number 
   of messages that can be sent.  Must be specified.
 * size: initial setting of the credit window tracking the remaining number 
   of content bytes that can be sent.  Defaults to the receive buffer size of 
   the TCP socket which is typically 65536 bytes.

If the `credit` header is not specified it has the same effect
as if it had been set to `credit:655360,655360`.  This setting allows the broker
to optimally stream many small messages to the client or without overloading
the clients processing buffers.

As messages are sent from the server to the client, the credit windows are
reduced by the corresponding amount. When the client send `ACK` frames to the 
server, the credit windows are incremented by the number of messages and content 
sizes corresponding to the messages that were acknowledged.

Example:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:mysub
    destination:/queue/foo
    credit:5,0
    
    ^@

The above example would cause the subscription to only receive at most 5
messages if the client is not sending any `ACK` messages back to the server.

If you need to receive more messages without acknowledging them than the
size of the credit window, you should use transactions and transactionally
`ACK` messages as they are received.  A transactional ACK increases the 
credit window without actually consuming the messages.  If the transaction
is aborted subsequent acknowledgements of a previously acknowledged message 
does not increase the credit window.

<!-- The following feature seems complicated and not really that useful.-->
<!-- Commenting out as it may get removed. -->
<!--

If the `auto` option is set to `false`, then the credit windows are only
increased when the server receives `ACK` frames which contain a `credit`
header. The header value is expected to use the `count[,size]` syntax. If
`size` is specified, it defaults to 0.

Example:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:mysub
    destination:/queue/foo
    credit:1,0,false
    
    ^@
    ACK
    id:mysub
    message-id:id-52321
    credit:1,1204
    
    ^@

You can also use the `ACK` frame to increase the credit windows sizes
without needing to acknowledge as message. To do this, don't include the
`message-id` header in the `ACK` frame. Example:

    ACK
    id:mysub
    credit:3
    
    ^@
-->

### Topic Durable Subscriptions

A durable subscription is a queue which is subscribed to a topic so that even
if the client which created the durable subscription is not online, he can
still get a copy of all the messages sent to the topic when he comes back
online. Multiple clients can subscribe to the same durable subscription and
since it's backed by a queue, those subscribers will have the topic's messages
load balanced across them.

To create or reattach to a a durable subscription with STOMP, you uniquely
name the durable subscription using the `id` header on the `SUBSCRIBE` frame
and also adding a `persistent:true` header. Example:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:mysub
    persistent:true
    destination:/topic/foo
    
    ^@

A standard `UNSUBSCRIBE` frame does not destroy the durable subscription, it
only disconnects the client from the durable subscription. To destroy a
durable subscription, you must once again add `persistent:true` header to the
`UNSUBSCRIBE` frame. Example:

    UNSUBSCRIBE
    id:mysub
    persistent:true
    
    ^@

If the durable subscription already exists you can address it directly using
`/dsub/` prefix on the `destination` header. For example, send a message to
the previously created `mysub` durable subscription, you send the following
STOMP frame:


    SEND
    destination:/dsub/mysub

    hello durable sub!
    ^@

Similarly, you can also subscribe to the subscription in the same way:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:0
    destination:/dsub/mysub
    
    ^@

Unlike typical STOMP subscriptions id's which are local to the STOMP client's
connection, the durable subscription id's are global across a virtual host. If
two different connections use the same durable subscription id, then messages
from the subscription will get load balanced across the two connections. If
the second connection uses a different `destination` or `selector` header,
then updates the original subscription, and the original connection will
subsequently only receive messages matching the updated destination or
selector.

### Browsing Subscriptions

A normal subscription on a queue will consume messages so that no other
subscription will get a copy of the message. If you want to browse all the
messages on a queue in a non-destructive fashion, you can create browsing
subscription. Browsing subscriptions also works with durable subscriptions
since they are backed by a queue. To make a a browsing subscription, just add
the `browser:true` header to the `SUBSCRIBE` frame. For example:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:mysub
    browser:true
    destination:/queue/foo
    
    ^@

Once the broker sends a browsing subscription the last message in the queue,
it will send the subscription a special "end of browse" message to indicate
browsing has completed and that the subscription should not expect any more
messages. The "end of browse" message will have a `browser:end` header set.
Example:

    MESSAGE
    subscription:mysub
    destination:
    message-id:
    browser:end
    
    ^@

If you want the browsing subscription to remain active and continue to listen
for message once the last message on the queue is reached, you should add the
`browser-end:false` header to the `SUBSCRIBE` frame. When the
`browser-end:false` header is added the subscription will not be sent the "end
of browse" message previously described.

### Queue Message Sequences

As messages are added to a queue in a broker, they are assigned an
incrementing sequence number. Messages delivered to subscribers can be updated
to include the sequence number if the `include-seq` header is added to the
`SUBSCRIBE` frame. This header should be set to a header name which will be
added messages delivered to hold value of the sequence number.

Example:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:mysub
    destination:/queue/foo
    include-seq:seq
    
    ^@

Then you can expect to receive messages like:

    MESSAGE
    subscription:mysub
    destination:/queue/foo
    seq:1
    
    Hello
    ^@
    MESSAGE
    subscription:mysub
    destination:/queue/foo
    seq:2
    
    World
    ^@

Furthermore, you can configure the `SUBSCRIBE` frame so that the subscription
only receives messages that have a sequence id that is equal to or greater
than a requested value by using the `from-seq` header. Example:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:mysub
    destination:/queue/foo
    from-seq:10
    
    ^@

If the `from-seq` is set to `-1`, then the subscription will receive messages
from the tail of the queue. In other words, it will only receive new messages
sent to the queue.

Note: You can only use the `from-seq` header with normal destinations. If you
attempt to use it with a wildcard or composite destination then the connection
will be closed due to invalid usage.

### Using Queue Browsers to Implement Durable Topic Subscriptions

You can use queue browsers with consumer side message sequence tracking to
achieve the same semantics as durable topics subscriptions but with a better
performance profile. Since browsers do not delete messages from a queue, when
you use multiple browsers against one queue you get the same broadcast effects
that a topic provides.

In this approach the subscribing application keeps track of the last sequence
number processed from the subscription. The sequence number is typically
stored as part of the unit of work which is processing the message. The
subscription can use the default auto acknowledge mode but still get 'once and
only once' delivery guarantees since:

 * consuming application records the last message sequence that 
   was processed
 * message are not deleted when delivered to the subscriber
 * on restart consuming application continues receiving from the queue
   for the last sequence that it received.

The `SUBSCRIBE` frame used to create the browser should add the `include-seq`,
`from-seq`, and `browser-end` headers so that they can resume receiving
messages from the queue from the last known sequence. If you are starting a
new consumer that does not have a last processed sequence number, you can
either set `from-seq` to:

 * `0` to start receiving at the head of the queue which sends
   the subscription a copy of all the messages that are currently 
   queued. 
 * `-1` to start receiving at the tail of the queue which to skips 
   over all the message that exist in the queue so that the subscription
   only receives new messages.

Example:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:mysub
    destination:/queue/foo
    browser:true
    browser-end:false
    include-seq:seq
    from-seq:0
    
    ^@

Since this approach does not consume the messages from the queue, you should
either:

* Send messages to the queue with an expiration time so that they are 
  automatically delete once the expiration time is reached.
* Periodically run a normal consumer application which can cursor the queue
  and delete messages are are deemed no longer needed.

### Exclusive Subscriptions

We maintain the order of messages in queues and dispatch them to
subscriptions in order. However if you have multiple subscriptions consuming
from the same queue, you will loose the guarantee of processing the messages
in order; since the messages may be processed concurrently on different
subscribers.

Sometimes it is important to guarantee the order in which messages are
processed. e.g. you don't want to process the update to an order until an
insert has been done; or to go backwards in time, overwriting an newer update
of an order with an older one etc.

So what folks have to do in clusters is often to only run one consumer
process in a cluster to avoid loosing the ordering. The problem with this is
that if that process goes down, no one is processing the queue any more,
which can be problem.

${project_name} supports exclusive subscriptions which avoids the end user
having to restrict himself to only running one process. The broker will pick
a single subscription to get all the messages for a queue to ensure ordering.
If that subscription fails, the broker will auto failover and choose another
subscription.

An exclusive subscription is created by adding a `exclusive:true` header
to the `SUBSCRIBE` frame.  Example:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:mysub
    exclusive:true
    destination:/queue/foo
    
    ^@

### Message Groups

Message Groups are an enhancement to the Exclusive Consumer feature to provide

* guaranteed ordering of the processing of related messages across a single queue
* load balancing of the processing of messages across multiple consumers
* high availability / auto-failover to other consumers if a JVM goes down

Message Groups are logically like a parallel Exclusive Consumer. Rather 
than all messages going to a single consumer, the stomp `message_group` header
is used to define which message group the message belongs to. The Message Group 
feature then ensures that all messages for the same message group will be sent to 
the currently assigned consumer for the group.  The assigned consumer consumer
for a message group may change but not before all messages sent to the previous
consumer are acked or if the consumer is disconnected.

Another way of explaining Message Groups is that it provides sticky load balancing 
of messages across consumers; where the message group value is kinda like a HTTP 
session ID or cookie value and the message broker is acting like a HTTP load balancer.

Here is an example message with the message group set:

    MESSAGE
    destination:/queue/PO.REQUEST
    message_group:hiram
    
    PO145
    ^@

The broker uses consistent hashing to map message groups to consumers.  When you add another
subscription to a queue, the broker will first wait for messages sent to previous subscriptions
to be processed and then the broker rebalances the message groups across the attached consumers.

### Temporary Destinations

Temporary destinations are typically used to receive response messages in
a request/response messaging exchange.  A temporary destination can only
be consumed by a subscription created on the connection which is associated
with the temporary destination.  Once the connection is closed, all associated
temporary destinations are removed. Temporary destinations are prefixed with:

* `/temp-queue/` - For temporary queues.  Has the same delivery semantics as queues.
* `/temp-topic/` - For temporary topics.  It has the same delivery semantics of topics.

In a request/response scenario, you would first subscribe to the temporary topic:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:mysub
    destination:/temp-queue/example
    
    ^@

Then you would send a request with the reply-to header set to the temporary destination. 
Example:

    SEND
    destination:/queue/PO.REQUEST
    reply-to:/temp-queue/example

    PO145
    ^@

The consumer receiving the request will receive a message similar to:

    MESSAGE
    subscription:foo
    reply-to:/queue/temp.default.23.example
    destination:/queue/PO.REQUEST
    reply-to:/temp-queue/example
    
    PO145

Notice that the reply-to` header value is updated from a temporary destination
name to normal destination name.  The subscription servicing he requests should respond
to the updated destination value (`/queue/temp.default.23.example` in the example above).

Temporary destination names actually map to normal queues and topics. They just have
a `temp.<broker_id>.<connection_id>.` prefix.  Any destination which starts with
`temp.` has a security policy which only allows the connection which created it
to subscribe from it.  These destinations are also auto deleted once the connection
is closed.

### Destination Wildcards

We support destination wildcards to easily subscribe to multiple destinations
with one subscription. This concept has been popular in financial market data
for some time as a way of organizing events (such as price changes) into
hierarchies and to use wildcards for easy subscription of the range of
information you're interested in.

* `.` is used to separate names in a path
* `*` is used to match any name in a path
* `{regex}` is used to match a path name against a regular expression.
* `**` is used to recursively match path names

For example imagine you are sending price messages from a stock exchange feed.
You might use some kind of destination naming conventions such as:

* `/topic/PRICE.STOCK.NASDAQ.IBM` to publish IBM's price on NASDAQ and
* `/topic/PRICE.STOCK.NYSE.SUNW` to publish Sun's price on the New York Stock Exchange

A subscriber could then use exact destinations to subscribe to exactly the
prices it requires. Or it could use wildcards to define hierarchical pattern
matches to the destinations to subscribe from.

For example using the example above, these subscriptions are possible

* `/topic/PRICE.**` : Any price for any product on any exchange
* `/topic/PRICE.STOCK.**` : Any price for a stock on any exchange
* `/topic/PRICE.STOCK.NASDAQ.*` : Any stock price on NASDAQ
* `/topic/PRICE.STOCK.*.IBM` : Any IBM stock price on any exchange
* `/topic/PRICE.STOCK.*.I*` : Any stock price starting with 'I' on any exchange
* `/topic/PRICE.STOCK.*.*{[0-9]}` : Any stock price that ends in a digit on any exchange

Destination wildcards can only be used in a SUBSCRIBE frame.

### Composite Destinations

You can use composite destinations to send or subscribe to multiple
destinations at one time. You use separator of `,` between destination
names.  For example, to send one message to 2 queues and 1 topic:

    SEND
    destination:/queue/a,/queue/b,/topic/c

    Composites rock!
    ^@

### Message Selectors

Message selectors allow a subscription to only receive a subset of the
messages sent to a destination.  The selector acts like a filter which
is applied against the message properties and only those messages
which match pass through to the subscription.  

Selectors are defined using SQL 92 syntax and typically apply to message
headers; whether the standard properties available on a JMS message or custom
headers you can add via the JMS code.

Here is an example:

    type = 'car' AND color = 'blue' AND weight > 2500

To create a subscription with a message selector, you set the `selector`
header in the STOMP `SUBSCRIBE` frame to the desired selector. Example:

    SUBSCRIBE
    id:sub0
    selector:type = 'car' AND color = 'blue' AND weight > 2500
    destination:/topic/foo
    
    ^@

### Destination Name Restrictions

Destination names are restricted to using the characters `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`,
`_`, `-` `%`, `~`, `:`, ' ', '(', ')' or `.` in addition to composite separator `,` and the wild
card `*`.  Any other characters must be UTF-8 and then URL encoded if you wish to 
preserve their significance.
